# 🌿 AirGuard – Accessible AI-Powered Ozone Dashboard
A machine learning-based air purification and accessibility-focused dashboard that predicts ozone output, classifies safety levels, and estimates indoor air purification efficiency — built to support individuals with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD.

## 📌 Overview
This project combines IoT-inspired data with software intelligence to improve indoor air quality using AI-enabled analysis. It features a multi-module ML model deployed as a **Streamlit web app**, optimized for accessibility and ease of use.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas

## 🚀 Features
- Predict ozone output (g/hr) using regression
- Classify air safety levels for respiratory health
- Estimate purification efficiency based on input factors
- Clean, accessible UI with real-time ML inference
- Hosted online via Streamlit Cloud

## 🧪 ML Models Implemented
- Regression model for ozone output
- Classification model for air safety
- Efficiency estimation based on calculated metrics
