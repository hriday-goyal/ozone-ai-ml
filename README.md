# AI-Powered Optimization and Control of a Low-Cost Ozone Generator

This project integrates machine learning into the operation and analysis of a self-built ozone generator, offering smart predictions, safety controls, and air purification efficiency simulations.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📌 Modules

### 1. Ozone Output Estimator
Predicts ozone output (ppm) based on voltage, time, gap size, temperature, and humidity using regression models.

### 2. Smart Controller for Safety
Classifies safe or unsafe usage zones based on WHO standards using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

### 3. Purification Efficiency Predictor
Estimates percentage reduction in air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5) over time using ozone exposure, runtime, and environmental factors.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- matplotlib / seaborn
- pandas / numpy
